### Variery of different Python Scripts

|Name   | Description   |
|-----------------------|:-------------:|
| Change Return Program | The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.|
|  Collatz Conjecture   | Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. |
| Count Words           | Counts the number of individual words in a from a text file and generate a summary. |
|Find Prime             | Program which given a range finds all prime numbers in that range. |
| Palindrome            | Checks if a user entered string a palindrome.|
| Port Scanner          | Program to check if a given port at a given address is open or not|
| Reverse               | Reverses a user entered string and outputs it|
| Bubble Sort           | Implementation of one of the most inefficient sorting algorithms requiring O(n^2) swaps and equivilant to O(n^2) time complexity (Pseudo-code courtesy www.algorithmist.com)|
| Insertion Sort        | Implementation of a simple sorting algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity, but using the equivalent of O(n) swaps.|
| Selection Sort        | Implementation of an in-place comparison sort with time complexity equivalent to O(n^2)|
| Merge Sort            | Implementation of a divide and conquer sorting algorithm with time complexity equivalent to 	Î˜(n log n). |
